# Election_Analysis
Module 3 Python

## Project Overview
The colorado Board of Elections wanted me to review a file with elections and audit a recent congressional election with the following assignment

1.  Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.  Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3.  Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate received.
4.  Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5.  Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Sources:  election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.2, Visual Studio Code

## Summary 
The analysis of the election show that there were three candidates:
1- Diana DeGette
2- Charles Casper Stockham
3- Raymon Anthony Doane

The results were as follows:
Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 of votes
Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 of votes
Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 of votes

The winner of the election was:
Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%

## Challenge Overview
The challenge faces with the analysis was that we had to learn how to write and save our analysis on on the text file.  Unfortunately, we are unable to show visuals to quickly look at the data to confirm a winner.

## Challenge Summary
We also need to use the looping methods to go through a list of repeated votes to tally the number of votes for each candidate.  It was challenging to iterate through the list and aggregate the vote for the analysis.
